# AirVibe Integrators Wiki
An internal documentation platform for the Machine Saver team, built around the AirVibe product-line.

## 🚀 Overview
The AirVibe Integrators Wiki is a dedicated knowledge hub where technicians, integrators, and business development teammates can access up-to-date reference material for AirVibe sensors.
It’s designed for:
Collaborative updating of integration procedures and field tips
Rapid onboarding of new partners or internal staff
Version-tracked documentation that reflects our evolving product suite

## 🧱 Key Features
Hierarchical navigation: Sensor categories → protocol reference → field deployment guides
Searchable content: Quickly find topics by keyword or tag
Integration-first approach: Each sensor page links to sample code, API docs, wiring diagrams

## 🏗️ Architecture & Deployment
Hosted at https://airvibe-wiki.machinesaver.com/

## 🧑‍💼 Who Should Use This?
Field integrators deploying AirVibe sensors at customer sites
Business development staff tracking sensor capabilities and integration promises
New hires onboarding into the Machine Saver ecosystem


## 📈 Why It Matters
By maintaining a central, living wiki for the AirVibe sensor ecosystem, we:
Reduce support calls by enabling self-service documentation
Ensure consistent integration quality across all installs
Capture tacit field knowledge (e.g., “tilt sensor mounted in awkward locations”) that often disappears
Accelerate partner on-boarding and reduce ramp-time for new integrators

## 🤝 Contributing Guidelines
Fork the repo and create a feature branch (feature/your-topic).
Make your additions or edits in Markdown.
Reference any diagrams or assets you use (place into assets/).
Run any local build/test to ensure links and formatting are intact.
Submit a Pull Request.

## 🧠 Tips for Effective Use
Use the search bar for quick topic access (e.g., search “soil-moisture sensor calibration”).
When writing new pages: aim for “What you need to know + How to do it + Common issues”.
Keep revision summaries short but meaningful (e.g., “Updated LoRaWAN downlink table for firmware v2.1”).
